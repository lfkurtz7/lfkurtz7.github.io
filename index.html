                            recently graduated
                            from Penn State. I have a Bachelor's degree in Media Studies, and have a strong passion for
                            Media
                            Effects. The communications field has long been my confort zone, which is why I'm branching
                            out in hopes
                            to discover something new. I am certainly passionate about technology and computer science,
                            though I
                            have a lot to learn.</p>
                        <p id="paragraph2">When I'm not working or studying, I'm probably out to lunch, playing with my
                            french
                            bulldogs, or running in the Wissahickon trails. I also spend a lot of my time with my
                            siblings, who both
                            live in Philadelphia as well. </p>
