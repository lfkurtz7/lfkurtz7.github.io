            <p id="paragraph1">Hi, I'm Leah! I am a 23 year old greater Philadelphia area native who recently graduated from Penn State. I have a Bachelor's degree in Media Studies, and have a strong passion for Media Effects. The communications field has long been my confort zone, which is why I'm branching out in hopes to discover something new. I am certainly passionate about technology and computer science, though I have a lot to learn.</p>
            
            <p id="paragraph2">When I'm not working or studying, I'm probably out to lunch, playing with my french bulldogs, or running in the Wissahickon trails. I also spend a lot of my time with my siblings, who both live in Philadelphia as well.  </p>
